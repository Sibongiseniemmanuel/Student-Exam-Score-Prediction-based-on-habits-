# Student-Exam-Score-Prediction-based-on-habits-
This project uses Linear Regression to predict student exam scores based on study habits, lifestyle, and demographics. After data preprocessing and model training, the model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.896. Study hours and sleep positively impacted scores, while excessive social media and Netflix usage were found to lower performance.
